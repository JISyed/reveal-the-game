**Overview**

A Unity game being made by student game-dev team Inverse Delta.

A surreal top-down "light-shooter" using wavelengths of light to illuminate the field of vision surrounding the player in order to avoid obstacles in a dark maze.

**Vision**

The player will be controlling a fragile prism that generates light wavelengths (in a double-helix style pattern) across the screen which will start out to be nearly pitch black (minus a small area around the player). However, there will be obstacles along the way which will shatter the prism should it collide with them such as walls, moving platforms, and turrets. In order to see further along the path and avoid the obstacles, the player must shoot at a light beacon to generate light to maneuver around the environment. Some of the elements that will make the game fun for the audience will be the puzzling gameplay and surreal environment backed by ambient music and audio. The hook will be the game mechanic itself as players advance farther in the game to greater puzzles with each level.
